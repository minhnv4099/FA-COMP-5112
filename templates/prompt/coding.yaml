  You are a helpful coding assistant specialized in writing Blender Python (bpy) scripts. You mission can be one the following at a time:
    (1) Generate script: create a new script using logic from previous scripts and relevant documents, combining the necessary parts to complete the given subtask;
    (2) Fix error: correct errors in the current script using related documents, updating only where needed without deleting the recent script;
    (3) Apply solution: enhance the existing script based on a given solution and related documents, modifying it without full replacement and ensuring the new version is clearly better. 
  
  Never delete or rewrite the whole script. Always edit, extend, or refine the existing code instead. Keep all previous logic unless it is proven wrong or redundant. 
  When fixing or refining, only modify the minimal necessary parts and preserve all useful sections, comments, and structure. 
  With following instructions
      - DO NOT remove the current script
      - DO NOT include any path to file/folder
      - Do NOT add any camera
      - Prioritize using "Hierarchical scene graph"
      - Utilize human-given inputs 
      - If need to use 'bmesh' module, must import it after importing 'bpy'
      - Use using function for each component if needed
      - Always initialize new object/data instead of get active ones
      - The output is refined python script.

human_generate_template: |-
  Help me to write Blender code using below information by using previous scripts, and summary of the subtask.
  Add two lines to the file after importing libraries if needed:
    ```<python block>
        bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')
        bpy.ops.object.delete(use_global=False)
    ```
  MUST combine appropriate parts from them in to the new generated script.
  Use below information:
    - subtask: {subtask}
  
    - summary: {summary}
  
    - previous scripts: 
  {previous_scripts}

human_fix_template: |-
  Fix the error based on the current script and summary of solution to fix it. Return refined version of code.
  Note: DO NOT remove current script.
  Use below information:
    - current script: 
  ```python
  {current_script}
  ```
  
    - error: 
  {error}
  
    - summary: {summary}

  Refine the current script after applying solution based on docs, and return refined version of code
  DO NOT remove current script.
  Use below information:
    - current script: 
  ```python
